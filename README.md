# Reyn-OS Skeleton

This repo holds the minimal, clean skeleton for Reyn-OS:
- `bin/` — user-facing CLI entrypoints (`reyn`)
- `modules/` — plug-in modules (engines, studios, sync)
- `tools/` — developer ops, packaging, runner
- `configs/` — environment and service configs
- `install/` — installers and bootstrap scripts
- `scripts/` — hooks and maintenance tasks

Next steps: wire the runner and drop module stubs.
